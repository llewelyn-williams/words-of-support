                        How we talk to ourselves isn't always compassionately.

                    <p>

                        There can be a tendency to talk ourselves down.

                    <p>
                        However, the same harsh words we might tell ourselves are unlikely to be the way we would talk
                        to someone else.

                        When trying to find a kinder voice it can be easier to imagine:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>
                            "What would you say to someone else?"
                        </em>
